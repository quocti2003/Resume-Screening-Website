Description: Implemented a text classification model using Support Vector Machines (SVM).
Explored the impact of hyperparameters (C, kernel types) and feature representation techniques
(TF-IDF with varying max-features) on model performance. Conducted in-depth analysis and
visualization to optimize SVM for efficient and accurate text categorization.
Key Achievements:
Developed SVM models with different kernels for text classification.
Explored hyperparameter tuning to enhance model accuracy.
Investigated the influence of TF-IDF features on computational efficiency.
Presented results through visualizations and insights.
Skills Demonstrated: Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Hyperparameter Tuning, Text
Classification, Python, Scikit-learn.Text Classification with model-processing
